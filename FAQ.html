        <div class="faq-item">
            <h2 class="question">ARE YOU AVAILABLE FOR MY DATE?</h2>
            <p class="answer">People who want to play outdoors! People who want to enjoy the outdoors without all the pre-planning, buying gear, figuring it out, and having to work at getting comfortable in nature. Our guests come from a broad spectrum of backgrounds, careers, ages and experiences. Ages vary from 5 years to 90 years old. Experience ranges from never camped before to grew up in the wilderness.</p>
            <h2 class="question">WHAT PLANNING PACKAGES DO YOU OFFER? WHAT DO THEY INCLUDE?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Here at Dream Weddings by Design, we have (6) different planning packages, ranging from what most call a Day-of Coordinator, all the way through a Full Service/Full Wedding Weekend Planner. We also are able to build custom packages for couples, and have many A La Carte options that you can add on depending on your needs + budget!</p>
            <h2 class="question">WHAT PLANNING PAPERWORK/ORGANIZATIONAL TOOLS WILL YOU PROVIDE US WHEN PLANNING THE WEDDING?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Before signing, you will want to ask what organizational tools/programs do they use to organize all of the details for your wedding day. Do they provide you with a timeline? A checklist? A Vendor Information sheet? A seating chart template? (we do.. and so much more!). You will also want to ask when you will have access to the planning tools as well!</p>
            <h2 class="question">WHAT DO YOU REQUIRE IN ORDER TO BOOK YOUR SERVICES?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Do they require a signed contract? How much do they require for a deposit? What is the payment schedule/When is the final payment due?</p>
            <h2 class="question">DO YOU HAVE A PREFERRED VENDOR LIST? WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR YOU & CHOOSING YOUR NEEDED VENDORS?</h2>
            <p class="answer">One of the best reasons to hire a wedding planner is because they usually have a list of incredible vendors that they can highly recommend to you. If you have done any research on wedding vendors on your own, you will see that there are thousands of choices for each vendor category, which can be very overwhelming. Your planner would only recommend vendors that they genuinely love working with, because not only do planners want their clients happy, but they want to work with people that they can trust & know that will do a great job (which in turn, makes our jobs so much easier)!
One of the best questions to ask a Wedding Planner regarding vendors: Do they have relationships with vendors that would offer you an incentive just because you are their client? We do! CLICK HERE to see our incredible list of very talented vendors for each of our branch locations!</p>
            <h2 class="question">I have a family with young children, can they go rafting?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Yes. There are, however, age and weight restrictions specific to each river trip, so please check into the details for the trip you’re interested in, and contact us with any questions or concerns.</p>
<h2><b>I am a senior citizen, can I go rafting?</b></h2>
<p>Many healthy people of all ages, including spry folks in their 70′s and 80′s, enjoy rafting at all levels.</p>
          <h2 class="question">What to expect:</h2>
            <p class="answer">Your trip begins when you meet us at our office at check-in time. We collect any necessary release forms and distribute  gear. Then everyone gets geared up.  The trip leader will assign you a guide, and your guide will deliver a safety talk  – a vital twenty minute discussion about how to be safe on the water.  We will then load on the bus which will transport you to the “put in.” At the put-in we move quickly to get out on the river. You’ll help carry rafts (many hands make light work). Once the rafts are on the river, so are you. You’ll receive a paddle talk, learn to paddle as a team, and be rafting before you know it. Then you’ll head on down the river, learn a little, enjoy the scenery, and hopefully, see some wildlife.</p>
          <h2 class="question">Do you take photos? Can I bring my camera?</h2>
            <p class="answer">xxxxxxx</p>
          <h2 class="question">Should I tip?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Tipping is always appreciated but never expected.</p>
          <h2 class="question">How early should we book your services?</h2>
            <p class="answer">One year in advance.</p>
